TODO:
 - multiple severities for sanity checks
 - improve handling of duplicate character IDs, currently the ones in the target database just get removed as we assume
   they are duplicates.
 - add feedback about merge outcome to GUI, currently an output file existing means success. For errors one needs to
   check the console, which is not exactly user-friendly.
